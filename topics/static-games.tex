\section{Static games}

\subsection{Basic Definitions}

\textbf{Game theory} is the study of mathematical models of conflict
and cooperation
between rational decision-makers.

Several things are needed to characterize a game:

% TODO: Itemize

- The \textbf{players} are the agents that make decisions

- The \textbf{actions} available to each player at each decision point

- The \textbf{information structure} specifies what each player knows
before making each decision,
in particular with respect to other players’ decisions

- The \textbf{outcome} for each player, which depends on all players’ decisions
